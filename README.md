# ASC2D
ASC2D stands for `a simple Cartesian 2D` solver. More specifically, this is a two-dimensional nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG-FEM) solver. Its purpose is for testing different non-reflective boundary conditions (NRBCs) in the context of the non-linear Euler equations. Additional information and/or templates would be provided, if users are interested.
